The course consists of lectures, written homeworks, and programming labs.  The
goal of the course is to **(1)** familiarize you with various modern
programming language concepts and paradigms and **(2)** get you to think about
and understand the design trade-offs and implementations of different language
features. We will use real-world languages (e.g., JavaScript, Haskell, C++, and
Rust) to explore the different concepts. But, we will not cover any one
language in full -- this course is not meant to make you a proficient
programmer, learning how to proficiently program in any of these languages is a
course in and of itself.


## Grading

-  5% Participation in class and online
- 50% Homeworks and programming labs
- 20% Midterm exam
- 30% Final exam

## Participation/pre-lecture readings

Before each class there will be some assigned reading. You are expected to do
the reading and have at least a vague understanding of the concepts that will
be discussed in class. This will allow us to spend the lecture time to solidify
your understanding.  Asking and answering questions in class, on Piazza, or
during office hours counts towards your class participation. 

## Homework and programming labs

We will have written homework assignments and programming labs.  Both are meant
to both reinforce your knowledge of the concepts covered in lecture and get you
to think about PL in more depth, beyond what is covered lecture (e.g., if you
were tasked with designing a new language).

You are expected to work on written assignments in groups of 3. All written
homework must be typeset and submitted as a PDF using the online submission
tool.  All written assignments must be submitted as a group.  Homeworks will be
released Sunday and will be due the following Saturday night (7 days). If
you turn it in early -- the following Thursday (5 days) -- you will
receive an additional 10% of your grade. There are no late days.

You are expected to work on the programming labs by yourself. You may discuss
the assignments with students from the course, in general, but not any specific
solution. Programming assignments will be released **Sunday** and will be due 1
weeks later on **Sunday** night. There are no late days.

If you consult anything (books, academic papers, internet resources, people not
in your group) when working on the assignments, note this in your submission.
We encourage outside learning but expect you to not seek out specific details
about a solution -- anything submitted should be considered your own work.
Similarly, you are expected to not publish or otherwise share your solutions at
any point (even after the class is over).

If you are unsure about what is allowed, please ask the course staff.

We will have a 5 written homeworks and 4 programming labs. They equally count
towards 50% of your grade.

### Tentative release dates for assignments

All assignments and solutions will be posted on Piazza. All are to be turned in
via gradescope. We will be releasing them on the following dates:

- **Written homeworks**: June 30, July 7, July 14, July 21, July 28 
- **Programming Assignments**: June 30, July 7, Skip Week, July 21, July 28 

## Exams

The midterm exam will be held on **July 16th**, in class. The midterm is
**closed-book**, but you may use a double-sided cheat sheet (letter-size).

The final exam will be held on August 3rd in **TBD** 
from 11:30AM-2:29PM. You **must** take the exam at this time and location. 
The final is **closed-book**, but you may use 2 double-sided cheat sheets
(letter-size).

The exams will make up 60% of your grade. Since the final is cumulative your
midterm grade will be calculated as:

```
midterm > 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0
```

This means that (1) you basically get a second chance if you don't so well on
the midterm and (2) you must show up to both the midterm and the final.  If you
need to miss either exam because of a documented medical emergency, contact the
instructor immediately.
